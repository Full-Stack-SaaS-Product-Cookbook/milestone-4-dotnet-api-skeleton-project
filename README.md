# milestone-4-dotnet-api-skeleton-project

The skeleton .NET API project to be used as a starting point for building. See the[milestone-5-mvp-backend](https://github.com/Full-Stack-SaaS-Product-Cookbook/milestone-5-mvp-backend) repository for the completed MVP version of the API.

# Installation

This repository should work fine by starting it in Visual Studio, or with the CLI command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

However, there won't be much to do or see as there are no endpoints defined.
